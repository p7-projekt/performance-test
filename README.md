# TODO
1. A generic setup function for creating x users, in y classrooms (possibly some timed sessions as well), exercises, classrooms, sessions etc.
2. A user object which contains an access token, session id (these are generated in setup, but contained in shared array with users (indexed with VU id)).
3. 10 exercises (correct, wrong answer, runtime error, timeout, compile error/syntax error). General switch to pick exercise, nested switch to select version of exercise (greatest chance of correct/wrong answer).
4. Mozart tests
